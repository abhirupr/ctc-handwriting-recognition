In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has taken
a town in the industrial North of England
and has made it live. The shabby streets
and wet pavements, the school play-grounds,
the public monuments and the rubbish strewn
canals - even the worn head-stones in the
churchyard, &quot;sacred to the memory of&quot;
- are seen as an integral part of the
story.

"It certainly was, Sam," Nick would agree, and go
on to say with a touch of self-importance: "No
wonder he tried to have me suffocated back
last summer. Must have thought I'd
rumbled him right from the start." By this
time Nick was certain in his own mind
that he had really seen Caxton's hand
snatching at the prop holding the barge's
hatch open, though he could never prove it,
and it would not be of much use if
he could.

The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's play A
Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester Square Theatre
tomorrow. It has been produced and directed by
Mr. Tony Richardson, who is also part-author with
Miss Delaney of the script, and the great advantages
to be derived from this unity of conception and control
are everywhere apparent.

THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
written in Greek. A modern text of the
Gospel represents the work of generations of
scholars who have compared the many manu-
scripts of John and worked out the version
which is most likely to have been the original
wording. It is not possible to establish any one
text with absolute precision.

In no other conquered country, not even
Poland, had the Germans begun with such a
drastic step. There is no doubt that the compatriots
of Eichmann would have been as good as their
evil word. THE Inland Revenue people have a
thankless task. But they do not make
themselves less disliked by their attitude
to their customers - who incidentally
pay their salaries.

We must beware, however, of supposing that there must be any
close analogy between the units of quite different
sciences. For example the success of the atomic theory
in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
units of geometry must be points. It would be more
correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
geometry.

At the centre of each circle stood personnel
managers of corporations, together with professors
and their filing clerks. The students had
bought their college education forward and
were now being bought forward in their
turn. By comparing personal appearances
with university records, the agents of the
businesses would pick on young men
and women who interested them, and contracts
would be initialled at the end of
the parade.

The Foreign Ministry spokesman added
today, however, that the Brussels Treaty
was irrelevant, because research on the
various rocket stages had already been
concluded, and only cooperation on the type
of capsule was involved. A lesser obstacle
to German participation is the absence of
any Ministry or Minister directly responsible
for it - and therefore of any budget
under which funds could be appropriated.

Drift in another form probably
explains how these migrating herring
are biased to east or west by the
different winds. Strong westerlies
are well known to bring good
longshore fishings. The surface
water that is blown offshore must
be replaced by an underflow bringing
with it the herring to the Norfolk
and Suffolk beaches.

'We've just had tea,' Nigel said. 'Would you like
the cookie to make you a fresh lot?' 'I'd rather

to the stage of using each other's Christian

Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
to have been guests at yesterday's
celebrations, and their friendly welcome
and warm sympathy, as she explained
how she had come to miss the party,
made her send a complacent glance
in Piers' direction. What a fuss-box the
man was, she thought impatiently,
trying to worry her into the belief
that her failure to appear at a function
on the estate was a major error:

The large attendance and atmosphere of
this Conference, held in October, 1957,
reflected not only an increasing awareness
of the problems of men and women nearing
or already in retirement but also a strong
desire on the part of all concerned for
concerted action towards preparing men
and women for life in retirement and more
adequate provision of facilities for
crafts, hobbies and leisure-time interests
for those who are retired.

Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-
strably better than the other? The centigraders may
be in for a stiffer fight than they think. They may
have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market.
Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
circumstances the time would come when this would
suit their convenience - rather than to change their
system of recording temperatures.

By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples.
He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his
health permitted him to enjoy anything. 'The Pearl', he
wrote, 'is arrived, which is a great resource. Vesuvius
seems to be tired; he is going out fast.... What a gay,
lively people, and what a busy town. At Rome, every other
man was a priest: here the priest is 1superceded by
the soldier - a favourable change in my eye, particularly
as the troops are very fine.'

Or it is possible that our sugya contains the

in the other sugya. (This can be supported by the
use of the expression: 'Boaz did it of his own

in Heaven' in both sugyoth. Such an
expression appears to have been framed in
response to the particular point at issue here,
whether the Heavenly Court concurred
in the decision of the human court.)

A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
at an intersection for the light to change. At his
apartment he garaged his car and then stood
listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the
earth had lost its life-tempo, as the heart
loses its beat in death.

Mauro's first action was to write to his revered master
at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking for advice. In doing so he
described his distinguished patient and his symptoms. He told
Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a strong, energetic man
with a gentle and charming character, even-tempered and
sedate, not easily irritated, patient and persevering, 'but he
appears to despair of ever being cured.'

When all seemed to be going well, a sortie surprised

&quot;Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out
of mothers, children and sick people than
to take on this vast industry,&quot; Mr.
Brown commented icily. &quot;Let us have a
full inquiry into the cost of drugs and
the pharmaceutical industry.&quot; The health
of children today owed much to the welfare
food scheme. It was maintained during
the war. Now in conditions of Tory
affluence it seemed it could not be
carried on.

According to Pliny, and others, certain
herbs and flowers proved of sovereign
power in preventing the approaches of
ebriety, or, as Bassius less clearly
expresses it, in clarifying the functions
of the brain. It is said that there is
nothing new under the sun, but regarding
foodstuffs the traveller occasionally
encounters a certain measure of novelty.

Ten minutes later he stopped in a lane
and helped me out with the same
careful courtesy. &quot;What sort of boat is it?&quot;

but she's sound enough and the

The motive would be the same in both cases, to
serve this home of his, in which his heart lay.
Here the rocket man's charm was disarming. Yet
when the time came to leave, Harry felt as de-
pressed as when he left Mrs. Halliday's office,
exactly a month ago. If even Mo statesmen only
did what they had to do to get GO on an expan-
ding scale, and left the sum-total of their actions,
and their lunar and earthly repercussions, to luck
(or to Moke), there was a vacuum where there should
be a centre of trust, responsible for the maintenance

In those early years 1914-18, life was very full
both in the parish and in the wider war activities.
The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in
Bavaria, asked me if I would do something for two wards
at the Royal Herbert Hospital, full of war prisoners.
I was very glad to help in this way, and visited them
frequently, establishing at once a friendly contact with
the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
someone who knew their native villages.

It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
Londoners, but it brought heavy censure from nobles
who still believed that they had a monopoly of
leadership. But, at last, Gaunt sailed. Opposing
him was the French Admiral, Jean de Vienne -
a great sailor and an able strategist.

This move today was a reminder of that fact.
Whilst she automatically patted the hand of

difficult though that would be. She became
aware that the pace was slackening;
now the coach stopped.

'Are you enjoying yourself, Olimpia?' she
asked idly, tapping the girl's cheek lightly with
her fan, in passing; but she did not wait for
the answer. Disturbed by vague uneasiness, she
was wondering whether Olimpia had been
watching her talk with Orsini. Surely she
could not have overheard anything they
said? A moment's reflection reassured her
on that point, for she was certain no one
had been standing near them.

Alongside these divisions a force of over 600
Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing
up. These &quot;fighters&quot; are in fact fighter bombers
which could launch an atomic attack on
Eastern Europe. By 1963 the Germans plan to have
nine missile battalions, with 288 missiles and
36 firing ramps, including weapons like Matador
(range 950 miles), also provided by the Americans.

At the present time in most of the towns
the waiting period has tended to grow, partly
because the buoyancy of industry generates
increasing demands, partly because in
recent years the pressure on the building
industry, the shortage of bricks and other
materials, and the shortage of skilled labour,
especially in the finishing trades, has made
it difficult for corporations to achieve
their full programme.

Lee, however, showed not the slightest sign of fatigue. 'I

he probably wanted to sleep himself. But, almost

'HELLO, CECIL. HAD a busy day?' His mother came into
the hall as he opened the front door. He nodded irritably
and, turning his back to her, contrived to slide the brief-
case into hiding between the do-it-yourself cupboard
and the polished brass fourteen-pounder shell-case
which served respectively as coat cupboard and um-
brella stand. 'You're later than usual, aren't you?'
His mother tidied her grey hair in the hall-mirror
they had once obtained as a free gift in exchange
for the labels from half a hundredweight of
Trunk and Greppes Tannin-free Tea.

This is not a filmed play. It has been conceived
throughout in terms of the cinema, and again and
again it is the visual qualities of the story, and
the marriage of the central characters to their
background, which bring the film so vividly to life.
In Fanny, which also has its premiere tomorrow,
the director, Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed
to create the atmosphere of a city.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough
over West Germany's cash offer to help
America's balance of payments position. He
said bluntly in Washington yesterday that
the offer - 357million - was not good enough.
And he indicated that his Government
would try to get Germany to pay more. He
did not mention personal talks with Dr.
Adenauer, the West German Chancellor.

He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the
provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her
to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases, but also
postponed demanding the tax until her financial year
was ended, audited and agreed by the Inspector. The
process could, and often did take several years.

At the same time that unity cannot be
established on a false basis, or by creating
further confusion within the movement. Unity
will never be established on the basis of leaders
being a law unto themselves and opposing
conference decisions when it suits their own
convenience. Unity can never be established by
any formula uniting those who oppose German
troops being trained on British soil and Polaris,
and those who are for this policy - which is the
same as that of the Tory Government.

devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted
to the gases and vapours which they use in the
course of their professional duties. We
ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-
ity was very small indeed. However, over a
period of eleven years, patients' lives had been
endangered in two known instances.

ON a March evening in 1932 in the New
Jersey family household the nursemaid
tiptoed into the baby's room to see that
20-month-old Charles Jun. was sleeping.
Bending over the cot, she suddenly realised
that there was no sound of breathing.
She thrust out her hand - and felt
emptiness. A FEW minutes later the father
gripping a loaded rifle, told his wife:

Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic. The
coach now turned in another direction, towards
the wild and desolate region behind the baths.
It was sparsely inhabited, dotted with fallow fields
and terraced vineyards, and here and there jutted
a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins, a pathetic
reminder of Rome's former greatness.

On the specific question of the use of Blue
Streak, Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be
easier. He can point out that this is the
only rocket and launcher in Europe to
have reached a sufficient stage of development
for adaptation as the first stage in
putting a heavy satellite into outer space.
There has also been some talk of adopting another
British rocket, Black Knight, for the second
stage, but the French have one of their
own called Veronique which they would
like to see used.

As in 1958, younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent
more per calorie than the national average, and families
with four or more children 19 per cent less. The only
substantial change was in families with three children,
for whom the index declined from 91 to 88. Table 27
also shows the corresponding values of an index which
compares the prices paid by different types of household
for the commodities constituting the average household
diet in 1959.

Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
might be bulky. It is sometimes possible to tell
whether or not a particular text was written on
a roll or a codex. Rolls were prepared for
writing, but any papyrus left unused at the
end could be cut off. If the text was longer than
the roll, a sheet could easily be glued on.

The party was now preparing to see
the tapestries, and in the general
movement, Vittoria was separated from
Orsini. Although neither of them
wished to follow the sightseers, there seemed
no alternative. As she was about to mount
a wide and shallow flight of marble
stairs, she became aware of someone
watching her intently, and turning
in that direction, she saw Olimpia,
standing beside her admirer, Orlando Cavalcanti.

His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of

with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
not wanting to smoke but needing some action
to help her control her feelings. &quot;Come and

lifeline and Gay got up quickly, mana-

Dai, meanwhile, was pedalling
furiously on the road. Not a sign of

walking very dogged towards Llangrwl.
&quot;Afternoon, Mr. Roberts,&quot; he called, polite,

He had seen no sign of an accident.
Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken.

They closed on a single bundle and, fumbling with
nervous excitement, he pulled it out. His eye
rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one
side. 'Old fashioned fivers!' he muttered again, and
tried to recall if they were still legal tender. Surely the
Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never
break their promise to pay on rude demand, let
alone on polite request.

And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed
on anyone convicted of sabotage. These stern measures
had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the
strikers gave in, but in Takoradi, the chief storm centre,
they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400
police and 16 armoured cars. And how did the
Government react when the strikers demonstrated in

This is the testing time for all. The affair blows up into
a national disaster and then when it is all over life
must continue as before. During this period the Captain
must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
if nothing unusual has happened. Harry Turton had
written letters to the bereaved, had visited many in the
locality, had been interviewed by the Press, had driven
his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
suitable for such occasions.

There are three kinds of reasons that justify
the protests and these should carry weight with
the U.S. Government, Earl Russell suggested. &quot;The
first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
U.S. and Great Britain, not only in Government
circles, but in public opinion.&quot; Earl Russell
says it is inevitable, though profoundly
regrettable, that the agitation against
the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
to the policy of the United States.

and Mr. Harry Nkumbula's African National
Congress (400,000) will meet in London today
to discuss a common course of action.
Sir Roy is violently opposed to Africans
getting an elected majority in Northern
Rhodesia, but the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Iain

With a vigour and authority which delighted
old Parliamentary friends and foes alike,
the Earl of Avon, the former Sir Anthony
Eden, in his maiden speech in the House
of Lords last night, gave a warning
that # appeasement over Berlin could
only lead to war. To stand firm, he
declared, was not to invite war, but
the surest way to avert it.

The Minister regards the recent trend
of recruiting figures as encouraging.
He is confident the aim can be achieved.
While the possibility of an eventual return
to National Service in some form
cannot be entirely discounted, he does
not agree that the point has been reached
where this need even be considered. If
National Service is ever resorted to,
engagement would probably have to be for
three years.

Nor is this to be wondered at, for even today,
in the 1960s, no cure has been found for
the 6tic douloureux. As early as 1830, when
Anglesey believed himself to be on the
point of death, the new German curative
method known as homoeopathy had been
brought to his notice.

It said that the President and Premier noted &quot;with satisfaction&quot; the
agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective Laos ceasefire,
which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement at the
Geneva conference. &quot;Particular attention was also given to the
nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament. &quot;The
situation in regard to Germany was reviewed, and there was full
agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and
obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin.&quot;

Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
sold. It is especially designed for simplicity in
construction, cheapness and lightness of weight,
and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
and an outboard motor with a comfortable
margin of freeboard.

The average gross return on established industrial estates
ranges from 7 to 9 per cent of the capital expenditure on land,
site works and buildings. Manufacturing industry affords
employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as
manual workers. An analysis made by Crawley Development
Corporation in 1958, after collating replies from fifty-eight
manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff,
showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as
managerial and administrative, 11 per cent as technical
or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical.

But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
be plunged into chaos, like the Congo. For Mr.

among Britain's major industries.

The result of the vote was not in
doubt. For the Tories were massed
in answer to their whips to defeat a
censure motion on the Government for
&quot;undermining the Health Service&quot; and
placing heavy burdens on those least
able to bear them. Mr. Brown
declared that the policy under censure
was monstrous. It had offended many
people far beyond the ranks of Labour
supporters.

Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no

Kaunda. Sir Roy, Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister,
said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence
Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia
National Congress, which was led by Mr. Kaunda
until he was outlawed in 1959. The record
of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went
back a long way, Sir Roy told the
Federal Parliament in Salisbury.

This was to give colour to his pretext for copying Byron's last
letter to his sister, which was that its chance of reaching its
destination had seemed slight. The collection of Pietro
Gamba's letters deposited among the Murray manuscripts show
that the greatest care was observed in gathering together all the possessions
of a man whose importance was fully recognized by everyone about
him. 'I have had put under Government seal his belongings,
which will be opened by Prince Alexander Mavrocordato
in my presence and that of certain Englishmen who are

Wagner was a highly practical feeder. He ate very fast,
placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as
he talked. Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe
which he washed down with beer. A writer who had dinner
with Dickens says the menu was Whitstable oysters, a brown
sole, a baked leg of mutton with oyster & veal stuffing and a
gin punch.

I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the

recently given Frankie the full, razzamataz, red-carpet

career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not
doing better here, before the platinum-plated Hollywood

So the arrival of any particular shoal
fish at a certain spawning ground may
be accidental. Yet there will always be some
that find it if enough are travelling, just as
the robin who gets back exactly may be
only one among thousands who do not.
But this southerly migration is not
accidental. Being contranatant or against
the drift, it probably has a survival value
in ensuring that the fry after hatching
are drifted back into the normal home

The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by
experiment for each batch of resin using radioactive tracer
(lead-210, bismuth-210). A typical elution curve is shown in
Figure 3. Once these volumes have been established, the weight
of resin used is also fixed. All available evidence indicates
that the fractions containing lead and bismuth are free
of cross contamination apart from the natural
ingrowth of the daughters arising from the decay of
lead.

He may never have had the disease himself but he
can nevertheless identify it. Similarly the psychologist has
to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
all kinds of processes in other people, whether or not they
correspond with anything in his own experience. We know
very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
provide our schemas, nor do we need to know as far as
psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
the neuro-physiologists.

The storage problem puts clay pots at a
definite disadvantage. They are fairly heavy
and difficult things to accommodate and
they must have some protection from severe
weather, which can be quite a headache in
a small garden. While admitting that
broken pots have on occasions provided
artists with delightful studies, there is no
doubt that a pile of badly stacked,
half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
from any point of view.

that the well-meaning corporation

All Aristotle was excited at the time, not by the prospect of the

not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere.

After what seemed an undue period of repetition, the voice
went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
in Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio

should be. Steve got out the car and traversed the
same empty streets as he had the night before,
to keep an appointment with Heather.

In spite of all the transferred maternity

poor Serena was an infant-in-arms as

tent of utter innocence. The complexity of
that innocence was colossal. It had layer
after layer of illusion to be peeled off and
replaced with sad knowledgeability.

So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the

hatred, we felt, was bound to be aimed at the representatives of
those who had, over the years, spread such ghastly havoc, destruction
and death over Germany, causing such wholesale slaughter among
men, women and children, old and young alike.

Informal talks at Lancaster House will

defended the appointment of a Negro as
his Housing Minister. It has aroused strong
opposition from the anti-Negro senators of the
Deep South. The negro is Mr. Robert #
Weaver of New York. One of his tasks will
be to see there is no racial discrimination
in Government and State housing
projects.

England, and returned to Rome for the winter. In late
November, he was 'suffering as usual', but hoped, he
told Arthur, 'to find this place agree with me better than
Naples. The journey has been against me, as there has
been much rain and damp, but the temperature is
high &amp; I have not yet thought of a fire....
A pleasant life truly!... It so happens that
I have an Italian who is perhaps the best
Valet de Chambre that ever was. But he has
not one word of English.' While he was writing
this letter he heard of the fall of the Whigs, and
the temporary assumption of the government
by the Duke of Wellington.
Obedient to the policy of his King, de Vienne avoided
trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
on land. Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
an elusive foe, and, afraid to return home without
something to show, he foolishly attempted to besiege
the well-protected fortress of St Malo. This
involved the dreary method of mining operations in
which Gaunt, under the Black Prince, had shown
considerable skill at the siege of Limoges.

Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of
ventricular contraction. During cutting or puncture of
the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion
of blood from the wound. Arterial diastole is
thus synchronous with cardiac systole but,
when movement of blood through arteries is
hindered by compression, infarction or inter-
ception, the more distal arteries pulsate
less because their pulse is nothing other
than the impulse of the blood entering them.

In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has taken a
town in the industrial North of England and
has made it live. The shabby streets and wet pavements,
the school play-grounds, the public monuments and
the rubbish strewn canals - even the worn
head-stones in the churchyard, &quot;sacred to the
memory of&quot; - are seen as an integral part of
the story.
In that year Shakespeare had just turned
forty and had written Hamlet two years
before. Bacon was at work and Milton was
just learning to read. James was followed by
Charles, in whose reign came the Scottish
Prayer Book in 1637. Significantly this made
a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
became the foster mother of some of the most
important Prayer Books in the Anglican
Communion.

writers, music composers and other
exponents of things that are

Thus learning how to learn means becoming
your own philosopher, your own psychologist
and your own teacher. You will then be
a well-established learner and the world
will be at your feet. Although the word
&quot;mind&quot; has given rise to endless
controversy among philosophers and psycho-
logists, many of whom would like to
abolish it from the dictionary, most
of us obstinately go on using it.

SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
told us that there was nothing an En-
glishman would not do; nothing an Ame-
rican would not say; nothing an
Italian would not sing; no music
to which the Frenchman would not
dance; nothing the German would
not covet; and nothing the Chinese
would not eat.

A small manual coffee grinder is useful as the resin
cannot be ground with a mortar and pestle. The
sieved resin is washed repeatedly with distilled water
to remove fines and then with hydrochloric acid to
convert the resin completely to the chloride form.
The 60-100 mesh resin is again washed with water to
remove the acid and finally dried in air.

Anglesey believed himself to be on the point
of death, the new German curative method
known as homoeopathy had been brought to
his notice.
There was always the spice of an orgy
in those Roman feasts, for instance, with
all their peacocks and nightingales'
tongues; unreasonable surfeit, too, in the
elaborate fashion of eating brought
out of Italy into France, we are told,
by Catherine de Medici. The peasant in
those days, as ever, ate sparingly, but
generously enough in his own fashion,
save at feast times, when he, too, let
himself go; and it was from his simpler

"How on earth do you know all this?" I asked
him. "I used to play about in these things
when I was a kid. And then I acted as guide
on a river boat one summer, to keep myself
going between terms at college." It was
the first I had heard of it, but that's
one of the things I like about Max.

First of all simple part-songs: I found only one member who had
any idea of reading music. This was the village doctor who was an
old school friend at Clifton. He could sustain the tenor part quite well
and lead the others. As for basses and altos the conductor had to
teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and by
the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
could render simple part-singing tolerably well.

ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial.
His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for
five years. During this period Britain will be expected
to subsidise and defend the Cypriots. They will enjoy
all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference. It is a
safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
company will sign on again.

That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine.
So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons,
the West, somewhere, must have them too. It
was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
purposes to be under the sea rather than on land.
This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
to oppose the Polaris depot ship.

The Orsini give that to traitors. There is
no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini. We hunt
a traitor down to the ends of the earth, and no

'Yes, signor,' she faltered. 'On the other hand,' he
continued, giving her a keen look, 'the Orsini are

Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
picture of this &quot;basis&quot; of mental phenomena?
The physicists have succeeded remarkably well,
with the atomic theory, in giving a clear and detailed
picture of the basis of such material phenomena
as chemical action, magnetism, the behaviour of
gases and so on. Where has psychology got to in its
theories of &quot;mind&quot;? Are there any ultimate units
of mind akin to the atoms of matter?

A new question asked about housing tenure, whether
the accommodation occupied by each household was held by
them as owner-occupiers; occupied in connection with
employment or as part of business premises; rented
from a Council (or New Town Corporation) or a private
landlord (if so, whether furnished or unfurnished); or
occupied on some other terms. The analysis of private
households by size and various characteristics of their
members has become increasingly important.

And, if certain dishes and modes of food have
persisted down the ages, the motive that preserved
them has always been the same. Apart from the need
for nourishment, the instinct of hospitality has
always been strong in mankind. The sharing of
a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
important than the casual meetings of the present
day; the desire to share something more intimate
than mere converse has always been there.

As they became known the Choir went to working-
men's clubs, to Conisborough on cheap trips to
sing to the miners, and sang for other organisations such
as the Bakers' Union, for whom they went on Satur-
day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel, to rally
the members. The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms
on West Street, where a successful Sunday
school was held.

I can't recall a production where so many
comics bolted in and out of holes so often.
The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
of his trousers. The action moved at tremendous
speed, backed by some wonderful timing by
the cast. I especially liked the tea-cup
scene where six of the cast changed
cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers.

We have held eleven meetings. We decided as a
first step to seek information from a number
of organisations and persons having an interest
in the questions before us and at a later stage we
arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
anybody interested to submit representations. We
compiled a list of the points which we thought
were of importance, but we made it clear that
the replies need not be confined to these
particular items.

This director is at last being re-evaluated and
given his proper place in the history of the
German film. Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
&quot;Unheimliche Geschichten&quot; (1920), five ghost stories
with a light touch, and there was much to admire
in &quot;Dreyfus&quot; (1930) and the virtually unknown
but extremely important &quot;1914&quot; (1931), which
tries to show that it took more than just
Germany to start the First World War.

After the First World War, 1914, I did not visit
Germany for ten years, by which time in
1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey.
Towards the end of my five and a half years'
incumbency I was asked if I would start
a village choral society and conduct it.
This opened up a new interest, and we plunged
into it.

This man was known to have left his home on February 11, and
to have been away for four days. Not in itself a crime, but, added to
the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
dford for a false moustache, it left him with something to
explain. His story was that he had left home to try to
join the Army (presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
his military bearing), and this was accepted.

This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more. &quot;I cannot be told
to sit down by the Prime Minister.&quot; Protests had been expected
from Tory rebels. But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented. He
accused the Prime Minister of &quot;political double talk.&quot; &quot;It had
the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
Minister is a national disaster,&quot; he said.

It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which
ended yesterday in 32 members of the
Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting
a breach of the peace. The committee's
president 89-year-old Earl Russell and
his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for
a week. Playwrights Arnold Wesker (The Kitchen)
and Robert Bolt (The Flowering Cherry) were
jailed for a month.

My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
his family, and found a very suitable house nearby
where my mother settled, and eventually died in 1926
at the age of 92. Dr. Burge was not able to be present
at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's.
This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich,
Dr. John Leake, who lived at Blackheath, and was
a close friend of ours.

he was 'suffering as usual', but hoped,

The East Anglian behaviour (see p. 82)
has always differed from that of the
summer fisheries. There is the &quot;swim&quot;
at slack waters, even in daylight
sometimes; and the high swimming,
when fish are caught only in the top
few yards of netting. These and other
fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
to this fishery, which unfortunately seems
to be dying out; but a full discussion of
them is beyond the present scope.

Some thought that the result would be all

of an illness, man of all trades, married to a commanding

Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
national income was spent on social services. The
present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
worthwhile targets for the Opposition. What a pity
to aim at the wrong one! MRS. MARCIA POWER,
whose husband made her clean his uniform, wins
a divorce. The judge says she had to act almost
as a serf.

The early speakers in the debate each
severely rated the speech of his predecessor.
These strictures were all too well justified.
We started with the plaintive wailings
of Mr. Healey, &quot;Shadow&quot; Foreign Secretary,
described by Mr. Godber, Minister of
State, Foreign Office, as &quot;pedantic and
obscure on Berlin, damaging and obscure
on the Congo.&quot; In turn, Mr. Godber was

Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital
alone. Of course one couldn't say for certain when a
doctor would be free during the day; tea was served
from four until five-thirty in the residents' common-
room, which proved the elasticity of medical commitments.
Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention,
she was convinced, or he would have granted her small request
to be met at the gates.

they must go. The best news for the Congo
would be agreement between its rival

relief when this strife-torn land gets

Nor is she necessarily being deceitful. She really did feel tired
until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
attractive - interest! Tiredness has, therefore, as much to do
with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion. A
disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
of fatigue. They wonder why they get no rest at night,
even if they do sleep.

The Secretary of State was empowered, on the recommendation of a

that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified
medical practitioner when required for purposes of
medical treatment.

Thrusting his head farther into the coach, he said

a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda
where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty, fifty,
sixty feet into the air, and dropped again and again, until
their arms were wrenched from their sockets. 'You have

of someone's lunch or a few secret files.

Mr. Iain Macleod, the Colonial Secretary, denied
in the Commons last night that there have
been secret negotiations on the Northern Rhodesia's
future. The Northern Rhodesia conference in
London has been boycotted by the two main
settlers' parties - the United Federal Party
and the Dominion Party. But representatives
of Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the
Central African Federation, went to Chequers
at the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan.

helped out on to the lawn, but he waved

Mr. Macleod went on with the conference at

day. Though he did not refuse wine, which the
judge always had on the table at dinner, he
did not act as though he found it necessary
except in moderate compliance with his father's
habit.

Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
trails. It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
money to her relatives, and her brother-in-law was asked for
a detailed account of his movements on the 11th. The dead
woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
named Brown.

The play was no more than a figment of
the imagination which asked the viewer to
believe in a beautiful ghost. It would have been
an impossible piece of television but for clever
production by Michael Hayes. He captured
the atmosphere of fog and mystery to great
effect. MORE than 100 viewers complained to
the B B C last night that an American film,
&quot;Britain - Blood, Sweat, and Tears... Plus

The urge came from a conference of activists of
Nkrumah's Convention Party &quot;after powerful addresses
by Comrades Krobo Edusei, Tawia Adamafio,&quot; and
others. Strong deeds followed strong words. In Takoradi
a &quot;limited state of emergency&quot; was declared, giving
the Government adequate power to maintain all
essential services and ensure food supplies. Thus it
becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment
for anyone who &quot;publishes a report likely to cause
alarm or prejudicial to public safety.&quot;

Mauro's first action was to write to his re-

asking for advice. In doing so he descri-

symptoms. He told Hahnemann that he found
Anglesey a strong, energetic man with a
gentle and charming character, even-tem-
pered and sedate, not easily irritated,
patient and persevering, 'but he appears
to despair of ever being cured.'

He gestured towards the bay where the full

IN 1913 Dr. Burge, Bishop of Southwark, asked me to go as
Vicar of St. Mark's, Woodcote, Purley, a new church built
by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne,
who was to become a very intimate friend, and I was
later on joint executor of his estate with his
solicitor cousin. As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield, we held
great family consultations.

He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as
his health permitted him to enjoy anything. 'The
Pearl', he wrote, 'is arrived, which is a great
resource. Vesuvius seems to be tired; he is
going out fast.... What a gay, lively people, and
what a busy town. At Rome, every other man
was a priest: here the priest is 1superceded by
the soldier - a favourable change in my eye,
particularly as the troops are very fine.'
Now let him go and you won't have to wait
long for the right man for you to come
along. If I was thirty years younger and weren't

It is not easy to make an economic
comparison between clay pots and the various
substitutes; the former may last indefinitely
with luck, while the latter are often
expendable used only once. Clay pots are
efficient and congenial containers in which
to grow plants. In their proper setting they
are not unattractive and, in spite of
their shortcomings, most gardeners have
a nostalgic affection for them.

Wholesale chemical spraying, upsetting as it
does the balance of nature by killing both pests
and predators, is viewed with concern by a
number of American State Research Stations. Not
content with issuing bulletins on the dangers
of the misuse of chemicals in agriculture,
some stations are carrying out useful research on
pest control by biological means. Both native and
imported predatory insects and insect pathogens
are used in field trial tests.

Present-day pots are better finished, do
not get dirty so readily and are easier to
wash. The deep rims make for neater and
safer stacking, though they are still
expensive and still get broken. On the
other hand, there is really no replacement
for the larger sizes, so they have the
decided advantage of being the only
suitable container available in quantity
for fairly large plants.

A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine, paid
for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament.
Those who lend their names to this kind of
advertisement are worthy people, a little innocent
of politics, perhaps, or carried away by the
idea that moral regeneration would solve
all our problems. So it would. While we are
waiting for the millenium, however, most of us
would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in
instruments of democracy, such as trade unions
and our local and national Parliaments.

'They've found their own toy,' said Ormston,

At first sight the difference between
Souter and the other texts is rather
large. But the British text includes
the paragraph 7.53-8.11, the Woman
taken in Adultery, and this accounts
for 178 words out of 279, which is
the difference between the 15,695 words
of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's.

Nevertheless, average net family income
was appreciably higher in families with
several children than in those with only,
many of which were incomplete families

'more like a God upon earth than a human being',
had an increasing number of disciples among unorthodox
medical men in the cities of Europe. One of these
was the Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey
consulted in May 1834.
This last objection might have had some weight in
ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural History, 13.11-12,
the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making.
As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79, his
information is contemporaneous with the New Testament.
The other form of book was the codex. In this the
sheets were bound together down one edge much as
they are in modern books.

The recovery of his balance was due to the
fact that he was living, virtually without

The next thing that Serena discovered was that

And this in spite of having at last managed

red pounds. The lawyer said:

This emphasis on the legality of the former

with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face.

track and turned towards the ruined Baths
of Diocletian.

I am more than conscious of this. How anybody
can go through the same routine day in and day
out for forty years I find difficult to understand.
A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
commerce may be kept going - though if ever
it becomes possible to work out a system
of 'staggered' hours it may do an immense
amount of good over and above relieving
the pressure on over-crowded trains.

MR. Macmillan has picked a strong &quot;brains trust&quot;
team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market.
And he has abandoned plans to visit President de

taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall,
but no more than that.

In April of that year his first wife's brother-

Italy, and that he himself was being
treated under a doctor who had studied
under its founder, the aged Dr. Samuel

Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose explicably

accents, they act oddly like the queer foreigners

He was a boarder. He could always turn on the

Some development corporations have sought
to attract private investors by leasing part
of the shopping area to companies experienced
in commercial development who have #
undertaken the building and letting of the
shops. But corporations have generally found it
more satisfactory to build themselves, leasing the
shops to traders, with breaks in the lease to
enable rents to be increased in scale with
the rising prosperity of the town.

It went, perhaps, some distance beyond
most treatments of its subject by attempting
to generate a melodramatic inevitability
which left its central character and the
world around him in complete, unredeemable
desolation. We could, perhaps, say whether
or not the attempt succeeded if we had a
little more faith in the way in which Mr.
Ferris manipulated his characters.
Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to
remove these doubts, and to persuade the
Federal Government that the financial burden
involved is really worth while, at a time when
any increase in budgetary commitments
would almost certainly involve a corresponding
rise in taxation - something no one is prepared
to contemplate in an election year.

Formula One, which appeared in February, appeared to make
this likely; Formula Two, which appeared in June, made it
very unlikely; if Formula Three restores the original
principle, that is all that need be required of it. It is a pity
that the Government should ever have been led away
from this principle. It is a great pity that the
Government should give the appearance of responding, not
to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations, but to
the violence which he tried to prevent.

Later in the year, the idea of some sort of
public employment was again in the air. Lady
Cowper, for instance, told Princess Lieven on
September 25th that Anglesey was very much
annoyed at not obtaining the Admiralty in place
of Lord Auckland, who had gone to govern India.
If there was any truth in this, Lord Melbourne's
letter of the following day, offering Anglesey the
Government of Gibraltar, may have been a
sop.

Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when
newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette Scott let
loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down
the river. The film starts off brightly enough but,
half-way through, the plot (as well as the boat) springs
a near-disastrous leak. Familiar members of Britain's
repertory team of comedy character-actors jump through
equally familiar hoops to mild laughter.

In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by an

They objected to the word Absolution. So the phrase 'or
the remission of sins' was added. But Absolution remained.
They objected to the word Confirmation. So the phrase
'or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
able to render an account of their faith according
to the Catechism following' were added. But Confirmation
remained. Other changes in the Book were equally
minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
added to the Catechism.

During the sixteenth century a considerable
amount of crochet was produced in the
convents of Europe. Without doubt it was the
nuns who carried the craft to Ireland. There it
was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
form with rosettes, leaves and lace fillings. During
the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
greatly abused.

All groups except families with four or more children
or with adolescents but no children consumed more fresh green
vegetables, especially in the first half of the year, although most
reduced their consumption of other vegetables. Purchases of
quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased, but extreme-
ly wide group differences persisted, the averages ranging from
0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more
children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult
households; average consumption by older couples and other
wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head per week.

In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law,
the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby, had written to advise
Anglesey to give the system a trial, adding that
it was being cultivated with extraordinary success in
France and Italy, and that he himself was being
treated under a doctor who had studied under
its founder, the aged Dr. Samuel Hahnemann.
Addressing the annual congress of the National Union
of General and Municipal Workers, he said he felt
sure the Labour movement was coming round in
support of his views. Obviously conscious of the fierce and
widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
Britain, Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that
supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
to the missile.

She had earned the right to be left in peace.
Byron's fame was, of course, very wonderful, but
it carried with it too many reminders of his
terrible indiscretions - the writing of Don Juan,
which she had never ceased to deplore, his
shocking blasphemies like the Vision of Judgement,
his making friends with the atheist known to
her as 'that infamous Mr. Shelley', and his
mixing with really low and horrid people such
as the subversive journalist Leigh Hunt, whom
on would never conceivably meet in decent society.

In fact, the Tories made it worse now
for the sick and needy than Labour had
to make it in 1950. And as a percentage
of social service expenditure, health had
fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent. Then
Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to
the unsmiling Mr. Powell. He demanded
that instead of taking it out of the
patients Mr. Powell should take ruthless
action against the drug making industry, #
whose profits had risen by up to 400 per

Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
effective, giving full value to the formal
elements of Betti's writing without over-
emphasizing them. Last night's play in the
&quot;Play of the Week&quot; series on independent
television, Then We Fall, by Mr. Paul Fer-
ris, was a morality on the not unfamiliar
theme of the destructive power of unbridled
ambition.

The relative expenditure per child declined from 1952 to 1956,
but rose in 1957 when the subsidy on welfare and national dried
milk was reduced; since 1957 it has again declined. Most of the
average expenditure associated with a child was on cereal foods,
potatoes and milk; for fresh green vegetables, fruit, cheese, fish and
carcase meat, the incremental expenditure was slight.

Top of the table, at the moment, is the chemical industry.
Then comes engineering, followed by iron and steel.
Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the

factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
up on 1960. Britain's business men are right to back

In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom.
Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure. But
they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side, or westerly, until
in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
echo-sounders. Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
their optimum depth; and this coincides with the suitable
gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
spawning herring are always found.

It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-

He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently
led along erotic paths which he knew existed, but
had never trodden. He learned how to use his
hands, how to adore that body without haste, how
to caress every inch with his mouth as well, to
creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
himself in a rapture of kisses in places he'd
dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened
his heart beat to a thunder.

called on Mr. Macmillan to cease his negotiations with
Sir Roy's representative, Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was

with &quot;growing anger&quot; the gross and unconstitutional&quot;
interference by Sir Roy's Federal Government in the talks.

to which her own had responded as it

Such a policy would unite the whole movement
and lay the basis for the defeat of the

The first reaction of the Sudanese
Government was to denounce the United
Nations for &quot;negligence and impotence,&quot; and
to say that its 400 troops in the Congo
would be taken home. The reaction can be
understood. The Sudan's concern for its
men is natural. But this could hardly be
a # dignified exit. IF the UN is
blamed for being weak, it would be
more logical to send in more men,
not weaken it further by desertion.

the Pilgrim had most treasured, scattered on the floor, -
as rubbish of no marketable value, and trampled on'.

Nevertheless, the tour has been an immense

There is, however, a danger that workers
will rely too much on fixed devices because
they fail to recognise their limitations.
It is therefore safer both in principle and
practice to keep the worker away from
overhead lines wherever possible, e.g., by
(1) re-routing the line, (2) putting the supply
underground, (3) making the line
dead (after consultation with the supply
authority), (4) providing barriers at a safe
distance to prevent vehicles from approaching

The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee, whose advice
we were invited to review, were to advise on: (a) the
circumstances, if any, in which the supply of morphine
and heroin, and preparations containing these substances,
to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded
as medically advisable; (b) the precautions which medical
practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or
heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
administrative measures that seemed expedient to
secure observance of those precautions.

rare intelligence and restrained power.
All that was part of the past, she would put it behind her. She

Except at Hemel Hempstead, large office
organisations have until quite recently shown
little interest in the new towns, probably because of
the difficulty in the early years in recruiting
suitable staff, especially junior staff, locally.
There is evidence of greater interest today,
with nearly half a million square feet of
office space under construction - almost as
much as the total area so far completed.

When the final miracle does occur, it is accepted as a
marvellous joke; no one has learned anything. Wicki
suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue. In
complete silence he shows the faces of people
walking in the streets, smug, content, satisfied,
and thoroughly frightening. Wicki has
succeeded in his second film in
recording his personal apocalypse of the
last days of a sick society.

we have a good illustration of how a

reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
with the comment given by Samuel.

This is not a filmed play. It has been
conceived throughout in terms of the cinema,
and again and again it is the visual qualities
of the story, and the marriage of the central
characters to their background, which bring
the film so vividly to life. In Fanny, which
also has its premiere tomorrow, the director,
Mr. Joshua Logan, attempted but failed to create
the atmosphere of a city.
Local offices of the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of National
Insurance and Inland Revenue are of course established or

Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
master at Ko&quot;then, near Leipzig, asking for
advice. In doing so he described his distinguished

that he found Anglesey a strong, energetic man
with a gentle and charming character,
even-tempered and sedate, not easily irritated,
patient and persevering, 'but he appears to
despair of ever being cured.'

The people - Langland's 'folk' and Gaunt's

feudal obligations of work or villeins who
had bought their release, free labourers
who worked for the highest bidders, free
yeomen who had prospered enough to become
successful farmers, the artisans, craftsmen,
journeymen and small tradesmen of the
towns, and the retainers and men-at-arms
in the pay of landed Lords.

Her husband's gentleness and amiability, his unselfish
love for her, she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a
futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
her a child. Whatever passion she had experienced in the
first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt.
She had never loved him. Her thoughts rushed to Orsini.
Since the meeting in the Doria Palace, no word had
come from him, and this silence oppressed her spirits
with a weight of misgiving.

and the sheet wound round this central pin. The roll made
a simple and serviceable book. It was robust - the number
which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of

was generally a single-sided form of book, and it was not
an easy form of book in which to find a

Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate
precipitates need be known because the concentration
of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the
algebraic equations. An effort was made to
detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in
the tracer by separating the lead-210 and the
bismuth-210 by anion exchange. The 15b-counting
of the lead-210 fraction began within a few
minutes of completing the separation.

overladen donkey, and a withered crone appeared
on the horizon, were overtaken and forgotten.

Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given
material in the sodium coolant circuit will start to
oxidise the cell can only be used as has been
suggested above, as an oxygen concentration monitor.
However, if a material oxidizes in sodium at a given
oxygen potential the reference electrode could be held
at that potential and oxidizing or reducing conditions
in the coolant circuit for that material would be
indicated by a negative or positive potential at the
reference electrode.

probably gain. &quot;Many people feel we have had, perhaps, too

a secret report to his chief von Papen, in Berlin.
&quot;Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion
of German rearmament, in opposition, to France.&quot;
Later that year he warned that Britain knew
Germany was breaking the agreement to stop
building bombers, and added:

By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled
perfumes, these refined voluptuaries aroused the
fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and
ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the
board. The gratification of the sense of smelling
was a subject of no little importance to the Romans.
They considered flowers as forming a very essential
article in their festal preparations; and it is the
opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the
number of flowers far exceeded the number
of fruits.

The "pot-au-feu" is as much a national institution
in France as is tea drinking among ourselves and it is
prepared at least once a week in every bourgeois
household. Thackeray, of course, waxed enthusiastic
about Bouillabaisse and sang - This Bouillabaisse a
noble dish is, A sort of soup, or broth, or brew,
A hotch-potch of all sorts of fishes That Greenwich
never could outdo; Green herbs, red peppers, mussels,
saffron, Soles, onions, garlic, roach and dace.

Every garden boy will agree that having to
wash clay pots is a definite factor in
favour of their abolition; in fact one
young man was so wholehearted about this
a few years ago that he made the headlines
for having smashed a large number # to
relieve his feelings. On the small-to-medium
establishment, it is a disagreeable chore
which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm,
whereas on larger establishments the pots
can be sterilized or washed by machine.

King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of
native kingdoms in Uganda arrived for talks with
Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod, before the
Uganda Constitutional conference opens next Monday.
The question: Their status in an independent Uganda.
The thorniest problem for next week's conference is
to settle the relationships between them and the
rest of the country. A Government report has
recognised their rights and recommended a form of
federal association, but the four kings are not

him a membership ticket for a

Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
ately refrained during the summer from
recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
by proclamation, such as would be
necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
on to a fully active footing. That
would have created a thoroughly unde-
sirable atmosphere of panic. He thought
that the situation was rather more
hopeful.

Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
pots for plant raising. These are compressed blocks of
compost, made in a specially devised press to
simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot.
Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape, they
are made of the same compost as would have
been used in a pot, the # only difference being
that it is used in a slightly moister
condition.

Certainly, the rise is very small. But it is a step
in the direction of live-and-let-live. Hopes
will now grow brighter of further international
co-operation, which is the only way to solve the
payments difficulties that upset the Western world.
Britain and the U.S., which have problems with
their balances, will gain some immediate help.
What it means in practical terms is that our
exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
for Germans to buy, while the goods which
Germany exports will be made a little dearer.

I suggested to the congregation that it needed
warming up by constant prayer and worship, and we
found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and
stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
for prayer and quiet. In time we received similar
gifts for the High Altar, and large East and West
windows.

There is no doubt what the Danes understand
by free trade. It is that they should be free
to sell as much as they like, while buying
more and more from our rivals. Germany has
now supplanted Britain as Denmark's
principal supplier. The farmers of Britain
understand free trade. That is why they fight
it.

All types of trader have been encouraged,

The one real weakness of the Commentator's
case is that, in common with all his colleagues,
he has not, until now, been able to exhibit exactly
how this enlargement was effected nor has he
been able to explain the textual movements by
showing that such changes are part of a
simple and coherent plan. To understand how
this is possible it is necessary to examine the

obvious morals for those who are judges long

the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
plate and mail of French knights, a brilliant
battle was no substitute for a sound policy,
and that, if archers had no target, campaigns
became mere marauding route marches.

has practised medicine for 43 years, chiefly

Conservative. I am horrified and amazed
by my party's proposal to prostitute the
whole principle of the State service and
to render that service a hardship to poor
people.

work. The only connexion is the
pipeline of the railway on which they
travel day by day.

He decided that it would be a great error
to do so and to recall Parliament. But
there would be no hesitation in mobilising
if a further deterioration in the situation
warranted such a step. It would have to be
accompanied by other measures of a military,
economic and political kind. Mr. Macmillan,
who was winding up the foreign affairs
debate, said the Government could not
be party to accepting as a matter of
principle the imposed division of Germany.

different in principle to the new defence statement.
They accept American nuclear bases, and also
the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy

who will actually give the instructions to press

The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
more than a fantasy. Thanks to the good
sense of the front line soldiers, the
meeting of East and West was marked by
the use of no weapon more lethal than
vodka. And the effect on the German people
of the first ten years of the promised
thousand of Nazi rule, so far from creating
a spirit of warlike frenzy, had produced
universally a dull bewildered apathy.

There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations. The
present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history. The
original was written on a roll, or codex, which fell into disorder or was
accidentally damaged. An editor, who was not the author, made what he
could of the chaos by placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in order.

Catherine looked at the books lying
around his room, and asked if she
might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
to read on the train. Catherine is 13.
I suggested she might find them dif-
ficult, but she said, 'Philip reads them,
doesn't he?' During the journey I read
newspapers and watched her pretty
frowning face as she turned the
pages of Babel, for she was determined
to let nothing get between her and

Only Mr. Lucas's actions, therefore, arose
explicably from appreciable motives. The
rest, one feels, were driven to effective action by
the author in spite of the ineffectuality with
which he had endowed them. One hopes that he
is not asking us to believe that, because of
their odd accents, they act oddly like the
queer foreigners of tradition.
And a fine old fuss there was about it, too.
Here are the known facts. On 10th July,
the bus, the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl,
left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual.
Aboard, apart from the crew, were Mrs. Megan
Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader;
pretty little Morfydd Owen; Mr. Stanley Hayball
and Miss Ethel Yates, hikers from
Birmingham; Price the Provisions; and the
Rev. Edwards.

So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head, that
famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in historic
interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German
bombs during the last war. Having deposited his
baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
went in search of a drink. The lower bar was
empty, save for the lady known by all habitue
*?2s as 'Seaweed', and a youngish, sharp-eyed
man who was staring moodily into a gin
and tonic.

This could hardly happen without the
herring having some orientation with the
sea bottom. It means that the crowding
is caused during the daytime, and that
the herring must continue to migrate over
the ground as well as in midwater and
during the swim (the swim at East Anglia
is always from the north).

If the duke made any reply to this, Vittoria did

the future would depend. Outwardly she was calm, but
her heart was beating fast, and the palms of her

was on the door. Glancing at Lucia he said in
French to Vittoria: 'Your maid ... is she reliable?'

The Russians now realised its seriousness. The

Alastair was a bachelor. All his life he had
been inclined to regard women as something
which must necessarily be subordinated to his
career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
his own life, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl
whom he had never met and on whom after no more
than a couple of telephone calls he was
prepared to place complete reliance.

And so they prefer objective methods. Since they cannot
directly look into the mental processes of another
person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
this behaviour. This is no more queer than the method

and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them.

In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements
from the dissection of living animals, showing how these move-
ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals
or in flagging warmer ones. At the time of its movement
the heart becomes generally constricted, its walls thicken,
its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
content of blood, appearing paler in so doing in animals
such as serpents, frogs, and the like.

worse the school system whereby for

In this region of Monti most of the public baths

the baths had lost their purpose; they had become

used these quarries as hiding places, to the danger
of travellers in the district.

of basting stitches. Work a row of dc all round

Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian
parties had refused to attend the talks
because Sir Roy had found messages
sent from the Government were &quot;unsatisfac-
tory.&quot; African delegates to the talks yester-
day called on Mr. Macmillan to cease his
negotiations with Sir Roy's representative,
Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was at Che-
quers last week-end. They said they
regarded with &quot;growing anger&quot; the &quot;gross
and unconstitutional&quot; interference by
Sir Roy's Federal Government in the
talks.

The mind tires first and conveys the impression
of tiredness to the body. This can be proved by
noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
body who feels thoroughly tired. Suppose
a mother has news late at night that her
child is in danger. She will undertake a
journey which, an hour before, she would
have declared impossible.

According to the legend, Solomon had asked the
Prince of the Demons, &quot;Ashmodeus&quot; to bring him
the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the
Shamir had not been placed under his charge, as
there is no Shamir in Gehenna (Hell). An eagle
brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden,
the Paradise, the only place where the Shamir
could be found.

in the 1960s, no cure has been found for the
6tic douloureux. As early as 1830, when
method known as homoeopathy had
been brought to his notice.
By delicate application of odours and richly-
distilled perfumes, these refined voluptuaries
aroused the fainting appetite and added a
more exquisite and ethereal enjoyment to
the grosser pleasures of the board. The grati-
fication of the sense of smelling was a
subject of no little importance to the Romans.
They considered flowers as forming a very
essential article in their festal preparations;
and it is the opinion of Bassius that
at their desserts the number of flowers
far exceeded the number of fruits.

money could have been disposed of in London
before your father left that evening. It wouldn't be
unnatural for a man in his position to make provision
for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded

money couldn't have been pinched by someone
passing the car after your father was dead.

MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded
defence of the Polaris missile base. And by
implication he supported the establishment of
sites in Britain for the training of German
troops. His main theme was that nuclear
weapons were necessary to defend Britain, that
Britain must depend on Nato and &quot;the West&quot;
must have nuclear weapons so long as the
Soviet Union has them.

happen just after the fish had risen above

was actually just off the bottom and was
indeed passing over some fish.

God grant, however, that I may be a false

was here, I understand, but an express took
him off yesterday.' While he was in Naples
there had opened a new chapter in the
history of Anglesey's unceasing search for an
effective alleviation of his painful malady.
None of the numerous conventional remedies to
which he had been subjected ever since the
symptoms had first shown themselves seventeen
years before had had the slightest effect.
The evil that Byron did certainly lived after
him, and was even outmatched by the
mischief perpetrated by almost every person
who had been close to him. In turning over
the bones Doris Langley Moore has brought
to light a great deal of discreditable
behaviour and a vision of mischief-
making propensities of the leisured
classes in the early 19th century which

Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud,
now so much nobler a figure than former historians
led us to believe. Laud was enthusiastically hated
by Calvinists and Puritans, and the sentiment was
mutual. But Laud was no Romanizer. One of his
first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
the Jesuit, Fisher. But anyone who was friendly
with James and Charles, the Puritans argued,
was necessarily a menace.

It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play. The place and its people were
to play an important part in my life. For five years in succession till
war broke out in 1914, I spent my summer holidays there and became
very intimate with the people and the environs. Every year between the
Passion Plays, an interval of ten years, another play would be
performed at the small theatre in the village, when new talent would
be discovered and trained.

And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
&quot;mind&quot; vanishes, at any rate for some time. It seems very difficult
to detach the mind from the brain, and all the biological,
surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
close connection. There is a lot to be said for keeping the
word &quot;soul&quot; to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable
essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word &quot;mind&quot; for
the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
are clearly associated with the brain.

still in greatest demand. It is mostly
in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
have made headway, and although
numerous small clay pots are used each

years ago. In the larger sizes there is still
no real substitute for clay that can be
obtained at a comparable price, except the
bituminized paper pots which are used on

Their friendship for Augusta became rather
hollow, and the news that Byron had left
her practically all his money caused it to
crumble to oblivion. Though Lady Byron
knew perfectly well that Byron, as early
as the year of their wedding, 1815, had
made a will in Augusta's favour, she had
evidently not passed on that information;
and it came as an appalling surprise to
Captain Byron that he had been left
without the fortune that would keep up the
title.

The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
brittle nature; even with reasonably careful
handling, the annual losses are often around
10 per cent., and where the handling and
storage facilities are not too good, these
losses will be even greater. This does not
necessarily apply to the larger sizes, as
they are not quite so fragile as the
smaller ones and are not normally thrown
about in quite the same way.

The porter at the station bore out this
description, but the man was not traced.
Perhaps the news of their search got around,
for a man did obligingly present himself
at Wandsworth police-station, claiming to have
committed the murder - but he was mentally
defective, and, despite his claim to infamy,
had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening.

They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles
was an iniquitous injustice. When they burst into
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Holland, Belgium and France
they really believed Hitler when he screamed at
them that they were being &quot;encircled.&quot; They really
believed in the moral superiority of &quot;The New
Order&quot; which Himmler on October 4, 1943, expressed
thus: &quot;Whether nations live in prosperity or starve
to death like cattle interests me only in so far as we
need them as slaves to # our Kultur; otherwise
it is of no interest to me.

'She is absolutely safe,' he replied; but he turned,
nevertheless, to the man who had peered into the
coach, whom he had addressed as Luigi, and gave him sharp
instructions on the matter. Vittoria stood looking about her,
breathing the scent of thyme. The land at her feet sloped
away into a tiny valley beyond which, on the crest
of a wooded hill-side, the ruins of a small temple
were etched against the clear blue of the sky.

These figures are much higher than the national
averages, and may be thought to indicate a
lack of balance in some of the towns. On the other
hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of
skilled employment and are highly diversified
as regards products, markets and methods of
manufacture. Consumer goods industries such as the
manufacture of food # and drink, tobacco, clothing
and footwear are under-represented in the new
towns generally though not in Basildon and
Welwyn.

Hoesch's reports, along with other nazi documents,

providing the cloak for Germany to build an
air force bigger than that of France.

The verso of the roll was blank, and one
cannot think of an author, Mark for example,
sending out his Gospel lacking the ending,
while one whole side of his roll was unused.
The codex form was not so accommodating. Even
in the case of the single-sheet quire, an extra
sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
over the binding, or the whole codex rebound.

One of the greatest steps forward that has been

of the mind is no longer feared or shunned,

physical illness. There is, nevertheless, a

no major complication but results from an
inability to deal with life, especially under

Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
continuing till old age to-day. When I went
to St. Mark's, the first contact I made was
with the Vicar's Warden, Mr. F. W. Charlton
and his family, the youngest of whose three
sons was just coming into the world in this year
of 1913.

A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
legs, and in reproduction period pieces they
are frequently used. The simpler varieties are
extremely easy to work, the four sides being
simply planed to give the required taper. In
the more elaborate varieties, however, a toe is
worked in the solid, and this certainly
complicates the operation.

Mr. Thorneycroft, the Minister of Aviation, who arrives in
Bonn tomorrow for talks with the Federal Government on a
European space satellite project, will find the Germans
interested in the principle of space research, but rather
sceptical about British plans for organizing it.
Stated more bluntly, they are still unconvinced that
this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to
salve Blue Streak, which was abandoned last summer
as a military project; or that the European space satellite
is indeed to be purely scientific in character.

The Hall proved most useful, especially in winter

Nor is this to be wondered at, for even today, in
the 1960s, no cure has been found for the
6tic douloureux. As early as 1830, when Anglesey
believed himself to be on the point of death,
the new German curative method known as
homoeopathy had been brought to his notice.
But there is heart in the telling, and an
intense realism in the situation. A young
girl lives in a single dingy room with her
slatternly, promiscuous mother. In such
surroundings she learns sex is something sordid,
and when she experiences it for the first time
herself it is incoherently, clumsily, but half
shyly and half inquisitively. As is the case in
Fanny her first lover is a sailor who leaves
her to bear his child and sails away.

Colonial Secretary, Mr. Iain Macleod,

For short ones a smoothing plane can be used.
The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers

A 90-day war, the West German
view, provides the pretext for huge
German armed forces (within Nato
of course) and for those to have
bases all over Western Europe.
In the past year West Germany

Belgium. After much bargaining

But why woodwork in particular? Well, there
are many reasons. Wood is in good and
common supply; it lends itself to making
innumerable useful household items -
furniture, fitments, garden items, toys, etc.;
it enables results to be obtained fairly
quickly; it is less expensive than most
other materials; it is a pleasant material
to work with; and, although it does
create a certain amount of mess, it is
all clean and easily cleared away.

Arguably, the dramatist has committed a technical
error in allowing Irene to speak for herself;
we would be altogether clearer in our minds
about her if she remained a flawed but beautiful
enigma, seen but not heard. However, Miss Pinkie
Johnstone makes her few brief scenes effective, and
exacting role, that of the sergeant, gives a performance
of rare intelligence and restrained power.
It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
woerd in his nightmare world. It is this that
makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
fluenced to change course. The Archbishop of
Capetown, Dr. Joost de Blank, has pleaded that
South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
Commonwealth. Otherwise, he says, those inside the
country who still oppose apartheid will be
left even more isolated and alone.

The total number of dangerous occurrences reported
during the year was 1,409, an increase of 111 over
the total for 1959. However, the number of
notifiable accidents associated with occurrences fell
from 252 (31 of them fatal) in 1959 to
245 (22 fatal) in 1960. The main increase in
the numbers of occurrences reported occurred in the
category of those due to the collapse or
failure of a crane, derrick, winch or hoist, where
there was an increase of almost one-third from
335 to 438.

When he learned what was causing the commotion he
became greatly alarmed, and after the body had been
taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his

she had met her death, and even less that it
had been murder.

Most of those who expound a theory of textual
dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
written entirely by one author before the
disturbance took place but a few leave it open
to suppose that the original book had been
revised even before the upheaval. The ingenuity
of the theories is impressive and is the best
argument against them.

the numerous conventional remedies to which he had
shown themselves seventeen years before had had
the slightest effect.
And so the inquest, which had dragged on, with
adjournments, until April 7, finally had to be content to return
a verdict of &quot;wilful murder against some person or
persons unknown.&quot; The most vital clue of the Wedgwood

The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's
play A Taste of Honey opens at the

advantages to be derived from this unity
of conception and control are everywhere
apparent.
From the day it hatches in the spring
until it dies in the late autumn, the
praying mantis satisfies its voracity by
eating other insects. Nine blowflies
may be consumed at one sitting and
the fully adult, 2 1/2-in.-long insect,
is able to keep a firm hold on one
grasshopper while eating another.
According to Dr. Max Beier in &quot;Fang-

1952), the praying mantis is trecking

using double standards. Ministers had
rebuked the unaligned nations for not
condemning the new Russian tests, but
they themselves had no condemnation for

take up moral attitudes, &quot;especially when
the temple of their religion is the

From this side, Rivermead was less forbidding;
it stood a long way back from the water
at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
flowering trees and shrubs. To the right of
the lawn, close to the water's edge, stood an
ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria; it
was built across a narrow backwater
and there was a delicate iron staircase
climbing the outer wall to a room above.

By the end of the month he still delighted in
Naples. He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
thing. 'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is arrived, which

The Messusah, which is nailed on the doorposts
contains those two lessons. The third lesson
of the Shmah (Numbers 15, 37-41) is
called &quot;the going-out of the land of

the &quot;tsitsits&quot;. This lesson used to be read

(both under 55) and couples with different numbers
of children were given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of

income with the family households, so that differences
in food expenditure may be associated with the

Mr. Macleod went on with the conference
at Lancaster House despite the crisis
which had blown up. He has now revealed
his full plans to the Africans and Liberals
attending. These plans do not give the
Africans the overall majority they are
seeking. African delegates are studying
them today. The conference will meet
to discuss the function of a proposed
House of Chiefs.
I had a distinct impression that the
hut had recently been cleaned and
prepared for visitors. Mrs Caine said
we were to go no further unless and

she was in touch with an invi-
sible source of authority.

So they proceeded to see if the coast
was clear. The street was quiet and
deserted, and there were neither sight
nor sound of flying saucers. So they
ventured forth and made their way on
foot to Dan's house. Dan came
to the door at their ring but neglected
to offer any greeting. He was deeply
preoccupied, and it seemed that the
ringing of a doorbell was to him
a new and strange phenomenon.

We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
that he was a great man for lace - paying
as much as 3 for a lace collar. But this
didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
for his lady, for he records testily: 'My wife
and I fell out about my not being willing
to have her gown laced.'

It has been left, however, to Mr. Goka, Ghana's Finance
Minister, to do the honours as host, in which capacity
he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador
Hotel. POLICE, on direct orders from the Cabinet, are
openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear-
disarming Committee of 100, the Committee claimed
yesterday. It said pressure was being put on
members and associates all over the country.

Before replying to this, she glanced

one of the most unreliable methods of getting

ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards

The two latter groups consumed much smaller
quantities per head of canned vegetables and canned and

Amen. MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
purely physical thing. The cure for which is sleep. This is only
partly true. Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
amount of rest seems to make any difference. Sleep, to be

Epicures and gourmands, sated by the unending
procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from

eye with magnitude, began to understand the value of
intelligent selection and comparative simplicity, though
nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
monstrous.

Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions
about housing and households. In 1961 the scope of the
question was wider than before, because of the great
use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local
Government and to local authorities. As before, the record
made during the enumeration lists all buildings, residen-
tial premises and temporary places of abode, and all
households occupying them, as the basis of the
enumeration is the household schedule.

Gay's distress and in a way that Doc, as a man, could not

Life at home and in Bath had been a

One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might
with time instil the reverence which, on Earth, nature inspires,
especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's
Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the
solar system. True enough, such ultimate weapons had not been
used in the last few wars, but it seemed very probable
that they would be in the next one, Moon and her
allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the
weapons pronounced conventional.

Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament

We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years.
If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red
with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation,
Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which

Questions about marriage and children were
again included, as they had been at the
1911 and 1951 Censuses. The former had asked
for marriage details for all married women,
the latter for all married women under
the age of 50. The 1961 Census questions
related to all women who were or had been
married, and so repeated the enquiry made
fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family
Census conducted on behalf of the Royal
Commission on Population.

When, however, the Greeks did learn the
art of making fireproof earthenware from
the Egyptians, their cookery made rapid
progress, because they were men of taste
and intellect. A remarkable peculiarity in
the banquets of the ancient world was the
fact that they did not confine the resources
of the table to the gratification of one
sense alone. Having exhausted their invention
in the preparation of stimulants for the
palate, they broke fresh ground and called
another sense to their aid.

That is doubtful. If however, in addition to her new

This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir
Francis Burdett described to Anglesey a
year or two later as 'more like a God
upon earth than a human being', had an
increasing number of disciples among
unorthodox medical men in the cities of
Europe. One of these was the Neapolitan,
Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey

In fact, the Tories made it worse now for the sick and
needy than Labour had to make it in 1950. And
as a percentage of social service expenditure,
health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent.
Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the
unsmiling Mr. Powell. He demanded that instead
of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should
take ruthless action against the drug making
industry, whose profits had risen by up to 400
per cent. in the last eight years.
They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours, so-

man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
the Thursday evening, with blood actually dripping from
his hands. The inquest was opened on February 17, but,
beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
in which she had died, there was nothing on
which to proceed, and the inquest was

neurosis and not in some eruption from those
deeper layers in the human psyche which are

Mr. Harold Wilson, Shadow Chancellor, jumped up to

This development coincided with the introduction of
pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air

greater part of the surface area could be made up
of fins only 0.006 in. (0.15 mm.) thick.

Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium
circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference
electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated
with niobium separated from the coolant by a
solid anionic electrolyte. A negative voltage from
the reference electrode would mean oxidizing
conditions for niobium and positive voltage, non-
oxidizing conditions. The practical application of
the above idea will involve considerable experimenta-
tion before it can be realised.

that enormous inroads could already

return to England, overshadowing her again
with spiritual and social peril. But this kind

Should the Herald publish such advertisements?
This is a difficult question. It would obviously
be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
which we disagree. When an advertisement
contains statements whose factual truth is
doubtful, or where the total content would be
deeply repugnant to our readers, it is right to
exercise editorial discretion. The MRA
advertisement falls into neither category, though
many readers will dislike it.

Some grim comic relief was provided by
an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot

The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to
West Germany were published in Moscow yesterday. They
tell: The U.S. - It is false to say the absence of a peace
treaty with Germany causes no real danger. West Germany,
with its militarists and revenge-seekers, is becoming a
hotbed of war danger in Europe. Even now, aided by
the U.S., Britain and France, it has more than enough
forces and arms to touch off a world war.

Powerful units have stood firm.
In unions where the central issues
were confused, clear policy details -

This, and the numbers of active
workers who are beginning to understand
how and why the trick was done,
provides a strong, immediate basis
for a campaign against weak and
doubtful positions, and for a consistent

known any way of cooking meat
except by roasting and boiling. When
Achilles gave a royal feast the principal
dish was a grill, which he cooked himself,
and he knew how to do it, too: - When the
languid flames at length subside, He
throws a bed of glowing embers wide;
Above the coals the smoking fragment

Does one, however, know who first thought
of boiling water and food? The ancient
Britons, I believe, used to make water hot
by dropping a red-hot poker into it,
because their pots would not stand fire;
but Jacob must have had one that
would, because Esau sold his birthright
to him for a mess of pottage - and then
we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt
after which the Israelites sighed.

In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks, Assistant Director
of Education for Glasgow, that industrial firms might be ready
to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
for retirement, their wages paid for the time thus spent. An
approach was made to about twenty large firms and in Oc-
tober, 1959, the first experimental day-release course for
men was organised. Eleven students from seven firms atten-
ded a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both
to the men and their employers that the venture was an
experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
as the participants.

The big Powers involved in the Cold War
must of course keep out. The Americans were
justified in diverting naval ships in case
non-combatant help was wanted; but they
stressed that there was no intention to intervene
in fighting. Yesterday the ships turned away
again, satisfied that they were not required.
It is to be hoped that the UN will be
re-established in their port by negotiation
and that there will be no more outrages.

girl lives in a single dingy room with
her slatternly, promiscuous mother. In such

is the case in Fanny her first lover is a sailor

Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
derived little comfort from it.

Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble

Easterly winds, on the other hand,
mean no herring along the shore, as
recent years have shown. A succession
of winds is needed for this effect of
course - one breeze will not do it,
though a very hard westerly will
often start off the "local" herring;
but quite apart from this wind effect
there is an easterly drift special
to this rump of coastline, caused by
the meeting of water from north and south.

One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
one: the cost of a pot of any description is saved
completely. Manufacturing the block and planting
it is very little more trouble than normal potting,
and a superior plant, which transplants more
easily, is produced. The obvious limitation #
is that soil blocks can only be used for
propagating; there can be no progression to a
larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
to be moved; it must be planted out or
potted.

We also had a little Mission Hall leading off

This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went

were lots of children there, and we had
a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
service. I soon saw that the parish needed
more help both at the church and Mission

The Bow-wave Theory. This assumes
that all fishing gear, when moving,
sends before it a kind of scaring effect,

Underwater films suggest that the

have also shown plaice moving before

A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure
to mediaeval eyes. It was determined that 100,000
was a fairer target, and the Parliament agreed to find
two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied
the remainder. The method of assessment to which the
Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax. The manifest
injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax,
but this lesson was ignored, and the injustice trebled in
weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult
had to pay three groats, but this time an adult was re-

This last point is certainly important because almost
everyone has come to recognise that machines
are not only an economic necessity, but that a

ripping out parts from hardwood. Most men
would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
were available.

The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the

the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the

This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
been the mood which produced the Black Rubric, for
it says that 'the Body and Blood of Christ, which are
verily and indeed taken and received by the
faithful in the Lord's Supper.' It could hardly be more

himself immortal by becoming associated with
a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
(which was never actually authorized!).

When Scarborough carried our point of view
we were naturally delighted, more so because
the alternatives had been put clearly to the
movement, which had then chosen a vigorous
anti-Nato, anti-Tory, anti-bomb and anti-German
rearmament policy. Hopes rose as we saw a
perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent
lines of difference with the Tories. Many members
understood that the bread-and-butter struggles
of the union would become easier in the context

There is only one way to develop unity and

was shown at the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, representing 800,000 organised
trade unionists, when it decided by overwhelming
votes, to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions
on unilateral disarmament, and to oppose
Polaris and military bases being installed on
the Holy Loch, or any other part of Britain.

Lastly, we suggest certain power tools and

depend partly upon the space available

Do not buy so-called cheap tools or

Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
outbuilding, but this was happening to him now. He
saw himself as a sulky, ugly, malformed, repressed
boy, then a young youth. He saw himself refusing
baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to.
Walking out of the chapel later on. Continuing
on, his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
canery and corruption, the growth of the dea-
dly decadence and absorption in debase-
ment and Satanic debauchery.

he told her, and suddenly seized her in an embrace

He was a socialist and believed in the right

would have nothing to do with him, others
would, and the comrades helped in many

One can remember with horror the pictures of the
overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
complete with heavy crochet antimacassars, mantel-
piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
numerous other crocheted pieces. It was some years
after the Victorian period that designers realised
the potentialities of the craft, and crochet was
revived with designs suitable for contemporary
trends. Crochet today has a variety of uses, and
has even stepped into the field of high fashion.

In addition to these revenues, the King had the

borders between private and public purse were
as ill-defined as the borders between private
and national war, and in which the comparati-

in the chancery, or the corridors of the United

in Canadian leadership, or the practical
politician, able to talk about sewage problems
in Algoma East.

There were two other sources of public revenue -
first, the Church, which wisely followed the lead
of the Commons and in its own Convocations
granted equivalent contributions, and second,
the foreign merchants, with whom the King's
officials had formerly made private bargains
at 'colloquies of merchants', and whose
payments were now authorized by parliamentary
sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
excess of the rate for native merchants.

Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
arithmetic which argued that, as the first
poll-tax had supplied 22,000, a tax of
three times the rate would produce 66,000.
The only concession made in view of the
objections to the first two poll-taxes was
the suggestion that the rich should help
the poor - but this was only a pious hope
because no machinery was provided for
carrying it into effect, and a subordinate

In appreciating this story, modern con-

taxation not merely for defence and

social services. A mediaeval oligarchy

the private wealth of the monarchy

crown lands, the fees of feudalism

A new method of applying sand to the
faces of green bricks has recently been
developed. In the case of wire-cut bricks
the column of clay from the pug-mill is
carried by a short length of belt
conveyor to the sanding plant.
This consists basically of a vibrating
hopper from which the sand is
distributed to all four faces by a
system of slots, scrapers and worms.

The libretto, by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman,
is largely a satire on the petty court
surrounding an ageing poet, whose deeply
egocentric character leads him to sacrifice
everything to his need of inspiration. Henze
obtains his musical characterisation by means
of individual instrumental timbres and &quot;personal&quot;
intervals, and the result is often less delineation
of character than caricature. This is also the chief,
or at least the most successfully executed trait
of the libretto, which contains an odd blend of highly

Remember that texture plays an important part in
the beauty of crochet. The finer mercerised threads
are more effective for the delicate designs used for
tablecloths, doilies, edgings and accessories, while
the heavier threads are used for bedspreads,
chairbacks, luncheon mats, etc. Crochet hooks
are made of steel, composition or bone. Steel
crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0,
the largest, to number 8, the smallest.

During this period, when large numbers of school-
leavers will be looking for jobs, there will be
relatively few retirements. For the most part therefore
local employment can be provided only by the
expansion of existing industry and the introduction
of new factories, laboratories and offices, and
the expected but not easily stimulated development
of the service industries. Schemes for training
young people in industry and commerce will
be particularly important in the new towns.

There was utter imbecility in his blank face. Presently the
muttering started again, and went on and on. Stunned and
shaken, Steve drew a glass of water and went back to
Heather. Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still
trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects.
For several minutes they had been facing each other across
a low table, like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with
each other through forced association.

Oversew crochet to the dc. A household word,
Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities which
are of the utmost importance to the worker.
It washes beautifully, never loses its colour
nor becomes 'stringy', is very elastic and
preserves the beauty of the design. It is easy
to work with, soft, glossy and of uniform
thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread.

But this time there was a very interesting
attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
payments demanded. The definition of an
adult was altered to read 'over sixteen',
and, where the poorest were to pay a groat,
the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks,
and between these two extremes a graduated
scale of payments was fixed for the
different classes of laymen and clerics.

concept which is current today. It is known as the schema.
It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction.

Seed is sown, or seedlings are pricked out into them
in the normal way, the only real difference
being that more of the watering is done through a
rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout

celery and onions, may all be raised in soil
blocks; so can such flowering plants as
dahlias, chrysanthemums, salvias, sweet peas,

This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be
obtained with tubular constructions. The growth of the
aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need
for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930's,
the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction
became established for aero-engine radiators, using
dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages
were separated by flat plates.

Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
co-operation especially with the other Christian communities.
At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
'Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund' in whose counsels and committees
I found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help
wives and relations of the soldiers to get their 'Separation'
allowances, but soon, alas!, as casualties began and increased
in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
became very urgent, and I was asked to be Chairman
of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.

But there is heart in the telling, and an intense
realism in the situation. A young girl lives in
a single dingy room with her slatternly,
promiscuous mother. In such surroundings she
learns sex is something sordid, and when she
experiences it for the first time herself it
is incoherently, clumsily, but half shyly and
half inquisitively. As is the case in Fanny her
first lover is a sailor who leaves her to bear
his child and sails away.
'Not at all. I'll show you.' 'Oh no,'

Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained

again, she has a key role. Let her tell men like Strauss
that he shall have no bases or &quot;facilities,&quot; no help in

afternoon service at the church, each child

largely based on this. It was on a

This is particularly important in estimating the trends
in the size and pattern of families for successive

Let us consider first what would
appear to be the simplest case -
that of flat fish on the bottom.
The evidence suggest that the fish are
aware of the moving footrope before
it reaches them. They move away before
it, swimming at the same speed
for an unknown period of time, until
they become (1) tired, or (2) more used
to the disturbance.

"Left here all right," said Ifor. "Two-thirty-five, on the dot." "It's

"Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables," Ifor said,
reasonably. "Start running punctual and where are you? People get

Well, the Rev. Edwards had taken command. "Our
position," he said, "is somewhat analogous to

his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a

a supply of food."

Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always insensi-
tively pushing, Miss Sheila Allen his wife,
always palely appealing, Mr. James Maxwell,
the editor, always comically abashed by
the events, and Mr. Aubrey Richards, the
father-in-law, always comically grotesque;
they were not asked to modulate from
their set moods but played with proper
efficiency and, in the case of Mr. Richards,
with lavish and suitably gaudy colour.

Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for
whom she worked as a book-keeper.

pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle, who

Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin
with what we have called a bare minimum kit. Probably
most men have some of the tools already. It will enable
a man to make simple, straight-forward things, and in
any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
which other tools can be added as the need arises. The
nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
to be made, but as a guide we have given a fuller kit
which increases the range of things that can be
made enormously.

Even worse is to laugh. Tremendous damage may be done to a child
by laughing at what are very real fears. As adults, we know
that their fears are groundless, indeed to us they appear laughable,
but to a child they are very real. Not that I am suggesting
that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
to face their fears, to see through them and come out on the
other side as victors.

For this fairly small group, comparisons between different
years cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a
defined number of children. In 1959 the households in
this group contained slightly more children (average 4.64)
than in the previous year (average 4.53). Their total food
expenditure increased less than that in other groups,
and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish,
poultry, eggs, canned vegetables, fresh fruit, chocolate
biscuits and breakfast cereals which, in general, are more
expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which
they purchased less, namely dried milk, potatoes, carcase
meat, sugar, bread, flour and oatmeal and oat products.

In many cases, their homes know little of
their place of work and their associates at
the office or works wonder what they
are possibly like in the surroundings of their
homes. It is easy, desperately easy, to lead
a 'double' life without ever deliberately
planning to do so or in fact being conscious
of what is going on. It is easier to live life in
compartments but over the years it builds up,
and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
need to be handled correctly.

to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine,

distinction that nothing else can give.

MR. IAIN MACLEOD, the Colonial Secretary,
denied in the Commons last night that
there have been secret negotiations on
Northern Rhodesia's future. The Northern
Rhodesia conference in London has been
boycotted by the two main settlers' parties -
the United Federal Party and the Dominion
Party. But representatives of Sir Roy
Welensky, Prime Minister of the Central
African Federation, went to Chequers at
the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan.

Motion there was, but motion without event - except
for those negligible events that seemed so large to
the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor
and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was
that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
had no place here.

There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to
Crawley. The development corporations have aimed at a varied
pattern of industry, offering a reasonable choice of

already established in their towns. Inevitably engineering,
including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries,
predominates in all the London new towns since these are
among the industries which have expanded most

HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly
in Rhodesia! Eighteen months ago this territory
was peaceful, orderly, and thriving. Africans within the
Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
administration. Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
Secretary. Suddenly everything changed. Timetables were
scrapped. The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
rushed out to Rhodesia. Overnight, minor African
politicians were inflated into international figures.

Consumption by younger childless couples declined
throughout this period, but that of the smaller families was
maintained except for the slight fall in 1959. In the largest
families, particularly those containing four or more children,
there was a tendency for consumption to increase between 1955 and
1957, and thereafter to decline. Graduated scales of family
allowances were introduced in October 1956, and the welfare
milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957.

But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
prefer unskilled jobs. Countless numbers who want training
are denied it. One area electricity board in 1958
offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450

the board. There were only 17 vacancies for the 58
boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth

Most tools have to lead an intensive life, and faults

yourself to blame the tools when the job does

It seems obvious that if an expedition to

Calais, Cherbourg, Brest, Bordeaux and Bayonne,
and that there was no hope of final victory
without a large-scale and concentrated invasion.

There was still an ease in our conversation, but its

And I suppose he felt the same. We had only a few drinks,

BEFORE the war he urged the British people
to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists.
After the war he favoured a preventive war against
Russia. Now he wants Britain to demolish her
defences. Throughout the years Lord Russell
and his supporters have been able to pursue their
eccentric campaigns in freedom. They should
ask themselves this question: How long would
that freedom last if their policies were adopted?

A small panel was formed, not on a formally representative

It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
Hammarskjold and the UN's servants. The
responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
which have undertaken the task of pre-
serving peace in the Congo. That is not a
ceremonial duty, and the soldiers have every
right to blame the politicians unless they see
it through. When the United Nations instructed
Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
prevent civil war, it was clear that new dangers
would arise unless it gave him the political ...

It would become easy to become cynical and
to despair. And yet, wherever the issues were put
clearly, sections of the movement reaffirmed their
original stand. Only where the issues were
posed so as to cause doubt and confusion
were positions lost. It is my view that this
immediate confusion hides the fact that the
Peace movement is still advancing and that
clarification of the issues can bring a
majority to # secure the Scarborough

Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes in food. At one

without going through the formality of having his turbot
removed first.

large majority of Labour 0M Ps are likely to turn

His only reference to Trelawny by name in the course of several
communications to Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron's affairs is
satirical: 'I have not the 1honor of any acquaintance with Mr

Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante....'
If Trelawny failed even to meet Lord Sidney and the British

explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young
Italian's expense.

The air passages were packed with corrugated
foil bonded to the primary plates to
provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer.
The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil,
chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand
the coolant pressure loadings. The introduction of the aluminium alloy
dip-brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up
for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial
weight reductions as compared with copper construction.

In most constituencies it may go down as

At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
be analysed into discrete bits. These bits were
identified as elementary sensations. These were
thought to combine together to form compound
experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
matter combine to form molecular compounds.
But this view led to too many difficulties and
was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search
for basic units of mind has gone on and will
doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to
discover ultimate units.

bring on an almost immediate feeling of

The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas

but rather that it is worth a trial in the event of

monitoring the oxygen in a sodium circuit. The
principal difficulty encountered by the author, in
determining partial molal free energies by solid
electrolyte cells of very stable oxides such as UO2,

carbonaceous impurities in the blanket gas.

is unwise. As I shall suggest in a

So once again the metaphysics were depressing,
and in absolute contrast to the physical display.
Mos have an un-American love of parades, and
these young ones, on parade for jobs which they
had to get to pay off their college bills, were naturally
putting their best foot forward.

Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
planing after fixing to the boat. Use your two
lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
purpose, the sides from one, and the bottom from
the other. If care is taken not to waste the
ply, plenty of material is left over for the thwarts.

The word Shamir was used as a
personal name (Git. 68a). The Hebrew
word &quot;SHAMIR&quot; means guarded or preser-
ved. Therefore, the real man, who
regards himself as insignificant, as the
prayer says: &quot;What am I? A worm&quot;, he
is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
the Shmah, loves the Lord God with
all his heart, and with all his soul and
with all his might and studies the
word of God.

None of these classes, except the yeomen, paid or

teenth century, the traditional methods of
financing the Exchequer had become stabilized.
When the King and his Council required additio-

export tax on the wool trade, collected by
means of that 'staple' system which ensured that
prices, quality and tax could be efficiently su-

Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not
interfere. Strontium does not form a chloro-complex
and therefore passes through in the feed solution and
the first wash. The resin is used for a single
separation and then thrown away. In the first stage
of the analysis, only the fraction containing
lead-210 is collected. The lead is precipitated as
the chromate, washed, slurried onto an aluminium
counting tray, dried under an infra-red lamp,
weighed, and set aside for five days while the
bismuth-210 grows in.

Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end meeting. But he told
M Ps yesterday: "I have no knowledge of secret negotiations."
He said Britain had an obligation to consult the Federal
Government. But the final decision remained with the British
Government. Mr. James Callaghan, Labour's Colonial spokesman,
said Sir Roy had no right to delay progress in the talks by
much as his health permitted him to enjoy
anything. 'The Pearl', he wrote, 'is arrived, which
he is going out fast.... What a gay, lively
in my eye, particularly as the troops are
very fine.'
&quot;For the stone shall cry out of the wall&quot;, like
Baalam's ass, &quot;and the purlin of timber shall
creak in answer&quot; &quot;if the roof of our security is
crushing our soul&quot; (see Hab. 2, 10-11). And it is
through the Shamir: &quot;That the earth shall be
filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; (Hab. 2, 14.)

A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
year, 1914, when war broke out. Very soon Chaplains for
the Forces were urgently needed, and I felt clearly
that one of us must volunteer. The Bishop, Dr. Burge, did
not wish me to go then, as I had barely been in the parish
for a year. Mr. Evitt, however, was much less committed
than his Vicar, and he was accepted at once and
was very soon in France where he did splendid
work until his health broke down and he had a bad
attack of enteric fever.

Vittoria, accompanied by her maid, Lucia, was on her
way to the Accoramboni villa, ostensibly to pay
a daughterly call on her father, actually to coax
money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting
debts. Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress
looked, and how cunningly the olive-green dress
with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her
perfect figure. Vittoria's thoughts were more complex.

crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting

stared speechlessly at the golden bear; Vittoria swiftly
averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance

some markings would be used, although which, it is

was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
substitute was the mutual self-help of
communities, whether those communities were

therefore in essence a forced payment whose
return was the uncertain bounty of booty
and the vague advantages of military glory;
it was therefore always granted grudgingly

cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights, of Spanish dancing

Does one, however, know who first thought of boiling

his birthright to him for a mess of pottage - and
then we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt after

into the path of some train? This hardly seemed
likely, since, when she was examined by a local
doctor, the woman, young, small, and rather plump,
was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
almost tight enough to strangle her, and the ends
thrust in her mouth like a gag.

George Anson Byron had seen enough of
the poet's atrocious conduct as a husband
to be aware that Augusta, so far from
being responsible for the collapse of the
marriage, had been Lady Byron's greatest
support and comfort at the time; but it
had been deemed necessary all the
same to enlighten him as to the suspicions
in the background, and he had repeated
them to his newly married wife.

But in 1897, alas! there was no fingerprint bureau,
no experts to check and photograph any 'dabs' it
might have yielded. It was a tough case to
tackle, and Superintendent Robinson, of the L.S.W.R.
Police, and Chief Inspector Marshall, of Scotland
Yard, combined forces in the investigation. While
accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
attacked for the sake of robbery, they did not
overlook the possibility that this might have
disguised another motive, and a thorough check
of her former men friends and acquaintances began.

in deep water, the later larval stages
migrate diurnally, and the adolescents
stay permanently at the surface.
